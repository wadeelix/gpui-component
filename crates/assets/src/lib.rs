//! Bundled Lucide icons shared by GPUI Kit presentation and behavior layers.
//!
//! [`IconName`] and [`IconNamed`] do not depend on GPUI Component. Register
//! [`Assets`] for the default component bundle, or [`AllAssets`] for the full
//! catalog. Applications can provide their own source for additional icons.

mod icon;
pub use icon::{IconName, IconNamed};

/// Embed application assets for GPUI Component.
///
/// This assets provides icons svg files for [IconName].
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// use gpui_kit_assets::Assets;
///
/// let app = gpui_platform::application().with_assets(Assets);
/// ```
///
/// ## Platform Differences
///
/// - **Native (Desktop)**: Icons are embedded in the binary using RustEmbed
/// - **WASM (Web)**: Icons are downloaded from CDN using web_sys::Request
///   - This significantly reduces WASM bundle size
///   - Icons are downloaded on-demand when first used
///   - Downloaded icons are cached in memory
