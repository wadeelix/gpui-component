# Mobile

:::info Current scope
GPUI Kit's primary target remains the desktop. Mobile support exists so that some components can be reused inside iOS and Android applications, for example rendering rich content natively with TextView inside a native screen. GPUI Kit does not currently plan to make mobile a primary target or to become a full mobile application framework in the way Flutter is.
:::

Mobile support builds on [gpui-mobile](https://github.com/itsbalamurali/gpui-mobile), created by [itsbalamurali](https://github.com/itsbalamurali) and developed with the community. Credit for the original mobile platform belongs to that project and its contributors. The platform supplies the [Window](./window), touch input, [text system](./text-system), and GPU surface; GPUI and GPUI Kit still own the Rust view tree and components.

GPUI Kit currently uses `gpui-pre-mobile`, a temporary compatibility package maintained in a [compatibility fork](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-mobile). It adapts the original project for crate packaging and publication alongside `gpui-pre`, and tracks newer GPUI versions to keep the integration compatible. Once the community `gpui-mobile` completes the integration and GPUI is published as a crate, we plan to switch this guide and its dependencies to the community `gpui-mobile`.

The current integration is experimental. The Swift-hosted iOS example has been built and exercised in the iOS simulator. Beyond this guide, GPUI Kit has been validated on iOS and Android in a limited scope: an AI chat area built from TextView, Button, Menu, Popover, Scrollbar, Input, Textarea and text selection passed functional and performance testing on both platforms, and the fixes from that work are in GPUI Kit. TextView is covered completely in that scenario. Other components and complete application layouts have not been validated on mobile yet. The fork's Android activity example is a different host path that this guide does not cover. Treat the iOS simulator path below as the documented target, not a general mobile support guarantee.

Native UI and GPUI can share one screen on both iOS and Android. The native side keeps the parts users expect to behave like the platform, such as the navigation bar and the bottom input field, and GPUI renders as one view between them. Each side keeps its own layout and input; the host places the GPUI view like any other native view.

## Run the iOS example

Start with the compatibility fork’s [Swift container example](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-mobile/tree/0b882efdac7f524e0bb0b1d4c886b2aa752f9f20/example). It includes a conversation UI with `Message`, `Bubble`, `TextView`, `Input`, thought summaries, and copy actions. Its responses are local sample data; it does not connect to an AI service.

On an Apple Silicon Mac, install Xcode with an iOS simulator runtime, Rust, and XcodeGen:

```sh
brew install xcodegen
rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios-sim

git clone https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-mobile.git
cd gpui-mobile
git checkout 0b882efdac7f524e0bb0b1d4c886b2aa752f9f20
cd example
./build.sh ios --simulator
```

The script builds the Rust static library, generates the Xcode project, and installs and launches the app in a simulator. Add `--no-run` to build only, or `--release` for a release build. At this pinned revision the script builds for `iPhone 16 Pro` with iOS 18.6 by name; if that runtime or device is unavailable, change its Xcode destination to one installed on your Mac. The example targets iOS 16 or later; this is a deployment setting, not a claim that every supported OS version has been tested.

Check the simulator used for **installation and launch** as a separate step. In the [pinned build script](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-mobile/blob/0b882efdac7f524e0bb0b1d4c886b2aa752f9f20/example/build.sh), `build_ios` sets the Xcode destination, but `_ios_run_simulator` later takes the first available iPhone from `xcrun simctl list devices available`. On a Mac with multiple simulators, changing only the build destination can launch a different device. Run `xcrun simctl list devices available`, compare its first listed iPhone with your chosen build destination, and, if they differ, update the script's `sim_id` selection to the intended simulator UUID before rerunning `./build.sh ios --simulator`.

For device development, install the `aarch64-apple-ios` Rust target and configure your own development team and signing in `example/ios/project.yml`. Re-generate the project after changing that file. Simulator execution does not establish device performance or release readiness.

## Dependencies

`gpui-pre-mobile` is the Cargo package name; the Rust library is `gpui_mobile`. Use a Git dependency while evaluating this integration. The package's `0.1.0` manifest version does not imply a crates.io release.

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["staticlib", "rlib"]

[dependencies]
gpui-mobile = { package = "gpui-pre-mobile", git = "https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-mobile", rev = "0b882efdac7f524e0bb0b1d4c886b2aa752f9f20" }
gpui = { package = "gpui-pre", version = "=0.3.4", default-features = false }
gpui-kit = { git = "https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-kit", rev = "7d9efcd2069f9eaa6eb3ba6345aac4aa7d87c9f7", default-features = false, features = ["component"] }
```

These revisions reproduce the example's dependency baseline. The Kit revision includes mobile platform gating but predates mobile tooltip suppression. The current GPUI Kit checkout uses `gpui-pre {{gpui_pre_version}}`, while this pinned mobile platform and renderer use `0.3.4`. Cargo can select both versions, producing incompatible GPUI types; replacing the Kit dependency with a local path is **not** a working upgrade by itself. First update the mobile platform and renderer to the same GPUI version as Kit and validate that combination. Only then can you use a path dependency such as:

```toml
gpui-kit = { path = "../gpui-kit/crates/kit", default-features = false, features = ["component"] }
```

Adjust the path relative to your application's manifest. Keep the GPUI core, renderer, platform, and Kit on one compatible release.

Unlike the desktop [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) setup, mobile does not use `gpui_kit::application()` or `gpui_kit::platform`. Those desktop platform exports are excluded on iOS and Android. The mobile host initializes GPUI, calls `gpui_kit::init(cx)`, and mounts a single `component::Root` around the application's content.

## Embed a view in UIKit

UIKit owns the native window, navigation, safe areas, and keyboard layout. The example's `GPUITextView` is a Swift `UIView` wrapper around the GPUI platform's child `UIViewController`. Despite its name, it hosts a whole Rust conversation view, not just one `TextView` element.

Use these files together as the integration reference:

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [App.swift](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-mobile/blob/0b882efdac7f524e0bb0b1d4c886b2aa752f9f20/example/ios/App.swift) | Native window, view wrapper, child controller containment, layout, and frame scheduling |
| [Embedding.h](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-mobile/blob/0b882efdac7f524e0bb0b1d4c886b2aa752f9f20/example/ios/Embedding.h) | Swift bridging declarations for Rust callbacks |
| [src/lib.rs](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-mobile/blob/0b882efdac7f524e0bb0b1d4c886b2aa752f9f20/example/src/lib.rs) | Application callback, Kit initialization, and Rust root view |
| [project.yml](https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-mobile/blob/0b882efdac7f524e0bb0b1d4c886b2aa752f9f20/example/ios/project.yml) | Rust build phase, static library linkage, frameworks, and bridging header |

The startup sequence is:

1. Call `gpui_ios_set_embedded()` before creating the GPUI application so the platform does not create a second native window.
2. Call the example-defined `gpui_ios_register_app()`. It registers a Rust callback with `gpui_mobile::ios::ffi::set_app_callback` that initializes Kit and opens the GPUI root.
3. Call `gpui_ios_run_demo()` to start the embedded application, then obtain its window and child controller with `gpui_ios_get_window()` and `gpui_ios_view_controller()`.
4. Attach the controller using UIKit containment: `addChild`, add its view, then `didMove(toParent:)`.

`gpui_ios_register_app()` belongs to the example, not the platform library. Adapt its callback to construct your own Rust view. The `run_demo` name is the current bridge entry point; it runs the registered application callback.

Once the example's `GPUITextView` wrapper is included in your app, a native controller can constrain it like any other view:

```swift
let content = GPUITextView(frame: .zero)
content.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
view.addSubview(content)
content.attach(to: self)

NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
    content.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor),
    content.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.leadingAnchor),
    content.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor),
    content.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.keyboardLayoutGuide.topAnchor),
])
```

This fragment uses the example wrapper; `GPUITextView` is not an SDK-provided UIKit class. Copy its containment and layout behavior along with the declarations and build settings, rather than copying only the constraints.

### Lifetime, resizing, and frames

The platform retains the `ApplicationHandle` returned by `Application::run_embedded`. It must outlive callbacks and rendered views. The current bridge supports one GPUI view for the application's lifetime; it does not provide independently destroyable views, multiple instances, or reusable collection-view cells.

In `layoutSubviews`, update the child controller's frame only when nonzero bounds change, call `gpui_ios_layout_view`, then request a frame. The example performs those operations inside a Core Animation transaction with implicit animations disabled, keeping the Metal surface and GPUI viewport in sync during layout changes.

The host drives `gpui_ios_request_frame` through a `CADisplayLink` while visible and invalidates the link when the controller disappears. Forward application active/inactive callbacks as shown in `App.swift`. Keep UIKit and bridge calls on the main thread.

### Input, fonts, and assets

UIKit determines the embedded view's safe area and keyboard avoidance. The GPUI platform translates native touch and text input for the Rust window, while Kit owns the component interaction inside it. Exercise focus, selection, editing, paste, scrolling, and on-screen keyboard changes in the simulator; a successful build does not establish that every input method works. `window.visual_viewport_bounds()` can change as the keyboard appears, while the layout viewport remains the same. Do not manually shrink both the UIKit container and the Rust content for one keyboard transition.

The example's embedded callback initializes Kit and changes the theme but does not install application fonts or an icon `AssetSource`. A font family configured for desktop may be absent on iOS, and glyph coverage for CJK or emoji can differ. For fonts your app requires, bundle the font files, register them with `cx.text_system().add_fonts(...)` before opening the GPUI window, then select those families in the theme. Check the actual rendered text and missing glyphs on each target; see [Fonts](./fonts.md) and [TextSystem](./text-system.md).

The dependency sample enables only Kit's `component` feature. If your app uses named Kit icons, enable its `assets` feature and register a suitable `AssetSource` on the mobile GPUI application before the first window. Native embedded assets and files addressed by runtime paths have different deployment needs: bundle and locate external image files in the app package, or provide an HTTP client for remote images. Do not assume a desktop file path exists in the iOS sandbox. See [Icons & Assets](./assets.md).

## Platform-specific behavior

`gpui_kit::is_mobile()` is an inline `const fn` that returns `true` for iOS and Android targets. It checks the compilation target, not window width or whether a mouse is connected.

```rust
if gpui_kit::is_mobile() {
    // Use touch-friendly interaction.
}
```

## Design for mobile

Share component behavior and content with desktop, while adapting the screen to touch and a narrow viewport:

- Let the native container handle navigation, safe areas, and keyboard avoidance. Avoid stacking a second title bar or duplicating safe-area padding inside Rust.
- Give each conversation one vertical scroll owner. For a `TextView` within that scroller, use `.w_full().min_w_0().scrollable(false)` so text and images fit the available width.
- Keep the composer compact when empty. Use a single-line input when multiline composition is unnecessary, and ensure the keyboard does not cover the send action.
- HoverCard opens and closes by tapping its trigger on iOS and Android. Tap outside to dismiss it; moving a finger does not open the card.
- A long press or double tap in an `Input` or `Textarea` selects a word with touch handles and an edit menu. For selectable, read-only `TextView` content, use a long press; its touch double tap intentionally does not select a word. These are Kit interaction paths that still need validation through the mobile platform's event translation.
- Make actions discoverable by touch. Keep copy actions aligned with the reply and use a brief checkmark after copying. Do not rely on hover text to explain an action.
- Prefer short paragraphs and purposeful headings. Let code, tables, and images support the conversation rather than presenting every Markdown format in each reply.
- Use Kit theme colors, type sizes, and spacing consistently. Check long replies, wide code, image loading, and Chinese or other scripts at the actual device width.

GPUI Base disables its tooltip overlay on iOS and Android. This covers Kit tooltips routed through that overlay, not direct GPUI `.tooltip()` calls. The pinned baseline above predates that change. Do not add native GPUI hover tooltips to mobile views.

## Validation and current limits

For an application integration, check launch and return from the background, keyboard show/hide, viewport resizing, text selection and copying, scroll behavior, and touch feedback. Inspect the actual rendered screen rather than relying only on a Rust compile check.

Measure rendering on a physical device with a release build and Xcode Instruments before making performance claims. Simulator results are useful for layout and interaction, but are not device frame-time measurements.

Android uses a separate activity and surface lifecycle. The repository contains an Android example. GPUI can be embedded as an Android `View` in a native layout, as described above, but this guide documents only the iOS steps. Outside the chat scenario validated above, Android Kit compatibility is not established. Validate the Android host path separately before depending on it.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Xcode cannot find the simulator destination, or the app launches on another simulator | The pinned `build.sh` builds for iOS 18.6 on an iPhone 16 Pro. Install that runtime or edit its Xcode destination to match `xcodebuild -showdestinations`. Then run `xcrun simctl list devices available`: the script's `_ios_run_simulator` installs on the first available iPhone, independently of the build destination. If that is a different device, change its `sim_id` selection to the intended UUID. |
| Device build fails signing or install | Replace the example development team in `example/ios/project.yml`, regenerate the Xcode project, and confirm the device appears in Xcode. The default script target is a physical device; pass `--simulator` explicitly for the documented simulator path. |
| Rust reports two versions of GPUI or mismatched `App`/`Window` types | Check the resolved `gpui-pre` packages. The pinned mobile fork uses `0.3.4`; this checkout uses `{{gpui_pre_version}}`. Align the entire mobile platform and Kit dependency set before using the local Kit path. |
| App launches with a blank or stale GPUI view | Check that the Rust callback opens a window, the child controller is attached, `layoutSubviews` publishes nonzero bounds, and visible frames are requested. Inspect the Xcode console; the example sends Rust logs and panics to `NSLog`. |
| Text, icons, or images are missing | Verify the font family and glyph coverage, registered `AssetSource` and exact icon keys, or the image's packaged path and HTTP client. A desktop asset or font configuration does not automatically carry into the mobile host. |
