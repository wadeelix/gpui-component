# Contributing Guide

Contributions are welcome, if you find some bugs or have some ideas, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Please ensure that you are using clean code, following the coding style and code organization in existing code, and make sure all the tests pass.

Please submit **one PR that does one thing**, this is important, and helps us to review your code more easily and push to merge fast.

## GPUI and GPUI Kit

GPUI Kit is built on top of GPUI. We do not aim to fork GPUI or maintain a separate GPUI implementation.

GPUI provides the core rendering, windowing, and platform capabilities. GPUI Kit focuses on the application layer, including UI components, application frameworks, developer tooling, and native integrations.

Changes to GPUI's core APIs or platform behavior should be contributed upstream. 

Extensions that can be implemented on top of GPUI without modifying it are welcome in GPUI Kit.

The gpui-pre crates provide version-aligned releases of upstream GPUI. They must remain compatible with upstream and must not carry behavioral patches, so that we can continue updating directly from upstream and use the official GPUI crates when appropriate.

The `gpui-pre` crates publish version-aligned snapshots of upstream GPUI, not a separately developed version.

Our automated process checks Zed's crates/gpui* weekly and publishes a new snapshot when upstream changes are detected. Before publishing, the snapshot is built and tested against GPUI Kit; the result is reported on the release, and the snapshot is published either way.

GPUI Kit pins the `gpui-pre` crates to an exact version (`=x.y.z`) in the workspace `Cargo.toml`, and the published `gpui-kit` crates carry that requirement to crates.io. A gpui-kit release therefore keeps building against the snapshot it was tested with, and a new snapshot only reaches applications through a gpui-kit release that bumps the pin. CI rejects a requirement that is not exact (`bun script/check-gpui-pin.ts`).

To move GPUI Kit to a new snapshot, change the `=x.y.z` requirement of every `gpui-pre-*` crate in the workspace `Cargo.toml`, run `cargo update` for those crates, and adapt GPUI Kit to any upstream API change in the same pull request. We adapt GPUI Kit to upstream rather than patching GPUI or maintaining downstream behavior.

This process allows the community to follow GPUI development with tested releases while keeping GPUI Kit aligned with upstream and compatible with official GPUI crates.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

GPUI Kit fully embraces AI-assisted development. We welcome contributions
written with AI, including pull requests where 100% of the code was generated
by AI.

What matters is not who wrote the code, but whether the change is thoughtful,
focused, and well validated. The contributor is always responsible for the
final result.

Before opening a pull request, please make sure that:

- The problem is real and the change is necessary.
- The API and implementation follow the existing patterns of GPUI and GPUI Kit.
- UI changes follow GPUI Kit's existing visual and interaction conventions.
- The code has been reviewed by you and properly tested. Run the affected
  stories or examples; screenshots or recordings are encouraged for UI changes.
- A pull request focuses on one thing and keeps the diff as small as practical.
  When using AI, ask it to avoid unrelated refactors, cleanup, or formatting.
  **Less is better.**

### Describe public API changes

A pull request that adds, changes or removes anything public — a type, a
function, a builder method, an action, a re-export, a JavaScript method or a
TypeScript declaration — lists it in the description under a `## Public API`
section, grouped by crate, with the signature as a reviewer would read it in
the docs. Say what each item is for in one line; a name alone is not enough.
The reviewer should be able to judge the API from the description without
reading the diff.

Changes to existing public items go under `## Breaking Changes` with a `diff`
block showing the old and the new usage, even when the old form still
compiles. Additive changes are not breaking, but they are still listed.

Well-prepared pull requests are easier for us to review and may be merged very
quickly. If a contribution is already in good shape, maintainers may directly
help polish small details and move it forward.

Issues are always welcome, but when practical, we encourage you to try a fix
and open a pull request. Concrete code often communicates a problem more
efficiently than a long discussion. A pull request is still subject to review
and is not a guarantee that the proposed change will be accepted.

## Code Style

Before you start to write code, please read the existing code to follow the same coding style and code organization.

- Inspired by existing code or refer to macOS/Windows controls API design to name your functions, properties, structs etc.

## Development and Testing

### System dependencies

The `script` folder contains some useful scripts to help you set up the development environment.

To install the system dependencies, run the following script:

```bash
./script/bootstrap
```

For Windows, you can run the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\script\install-window.ps1
```

### Accessibility-driven UI testing

When manual verification is needed for focus, keyboard, selection, menu, or
input behavior, use accessibility-driven interaction by default. See
[Accessibility-driven UI testing](docs/ACCESSIBILITY-UI-TESTING.md) for the
required Story app launch method, accessibility-tree workflow, and completion
evidence.

### Reviewing UI changes

When reviewing a UI or interaction change, check whether the UI tests exercise
the behavior claimed by the pull request, including its relevant states and
edge cases. If coverage is missing, describe the specific gap. Ask for a
focused manual check only when automated UI tests cannot exercise that scenario;
name the scenario and platform or integration to check. Do not request manual
checks for behavior already covered by automated UI tests. Examples that may
need platform verification include native input methods, operating-system
accessibility actions, system clipboard integration, and platform-specific
rendering.

### Run story

There are a lot of UI test cases in the `crates/story` folder, if you change the existing features you can run the tests to make sure they are working.

Use `cargo run` to run the complete story examples to display them all in a gallery of GPUI components.

```bash
cargo run
```

### Run single example

Standalone examples live in `examples/`. Run a package directly; see [the examples README](examples/README.md) for the available commands.

```bash
cargo run -p example-editor
```

## UI Guides

GPUI Component is inspired by macOS and Windows controls, combined with shadcn/ui design for a modern experience.

So please refer to the following UI guides when you design or change the UI components:

- [Apple Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/)
- [Microsoft Fluent Design System](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

### Rules

- Use `default` mouse cursor not `pointer` for buttons, unless it's a link button, we are building desktop apps, not web apps.
- Use `md` size for most cases and as the default.

## Profile the performance

When you change the rendering code, please profile the performance to make sure the FPS is still good.

You can use `MTL_HUD_ENABLED=1` environment variable to enable the Metal HUD to see the FPS and other performance metrics.

```bash
MTL_HUD_ENABLED=1 cargo run
```

> NOTE: Only available on macOS with Metal backend, and the FPS is up **limited your monitor refresh rate**, usually 60 or 120.

### Use Samply to profile the the performance

You can use [Samply](https://github.com/mstange/samply) to profile the performance of the application to get more detailed information.

```bash
samply record cargo run
```

Use `samply record` command to start rust development, and do some operations in the app that you want to profile, then stop the terminal with `ctrl-c`, then samply will open the browser to show the profile results.

## Release crates version

When we are ready to release a new version, please follow the steps below:

### Use the script to bump the version(Recommended)

```bash
./script/bump-version.sh x.y.z
```

### Manually bump the version

1. Run `cargo set-version` to set the new version for all crates.

   ```bash
   cargo set-version x.y.z
   ```

2. Git Commit the changes with message `Bump vx.y.z`.
3. Create a new git tag with the version `vx.y.z` and push `main` branch and the tag to remote.

   ```bash
   git tag vx.y.z
   git push origin vx.y.z
   ```

4. Then GitHub Actions will automatically publish the crates to crates.io and create a new release in GitHub.
