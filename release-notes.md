# Release Notes

## Pending Updates

### 0.7.0 (unreleased)

#### Root owns window overlays

`gpui_component::Root` now always mounts the dialog, sheet and notification
layers above application content. Opening a dialog, sheet or notification no
longer depends on the application's view rendering its layer. Notifications use
the Root's full bounds, and cached content does not duplicate or suppress layers.

#### Questionnaire: choosing a single answer confirms the item

```rust
pub fn choose(
    &mut self,
    item: &str,
    value: &str,
    window: &mut Window,
    cx: &mut Context<Self>,
) -> Result<(), QuestionnaireSchemaError>
```

Clicking a choice of a single-choice item, pressing Space or Enter on it, or
pressing its shortcut now confirms the item: after a 150 ms pause that keeps the
selection visible (none with reduced motion), the questionnaire moves to the
next enabled item, or submits on the last one. Validation still applies, and
choosing the already selected answer confirms at once. Arrow keys still move
the selection without confirming, multiple-choice items still only toggle, and
freeform input is unchanged. `QuestionnaireState::choose` is the new activation
path; `activate_choice` keeps changing the answer without confirming.

#### Added: `SettingGroup::variant`

```rust
pub fn variant(self, variant: GroupBoxVariant) -> Self
```

Overrides, for one group, the variant that `Settings::with_group_variant`
applies to every group. Use it when a single page should present its items
directly — `GroupBoxVariant::Normal` removes the card surface the global
default draws — while the other pages keep the global variant.

#### Plot moves to `gpui-base`

The chart primitives — scales, shapes, `PlotAxis`, `Grid`, `PlotLabel`,
`PathCaches`, the `Plot` trait and hover tracking — now live in
`gpui_base::plot`, so a design system built on `gpui-base` alone can draw charts
without depending on `gpui-component`. `gpui_component::plot` re-exports them,
so existing import paths such as `gpui_kit::component::plot::scale::ScaleLinear`
keep working; the API itself is tidied for 0.7.0 (see Breaking changes).

```rust
pub struct PlotElement<P>        // gpui_base::plot: the element behind every Plot
pub fn hover_progress(window: &mut Window, cx: &mut App) -> f32
pub fn is_hover_entering(window: &mut Window, cx: &mut App) -> bool
pub fn pointer_spring(cx: &App) -> Spring
pub struct PlotMotion            // pointer spring and hover enter/exit transitions
pub struct PlotTheme             // gpui_base::Theme::plot, carrying PlotMotion
```

A hand-written plot becomes an element with
`impl IntoElement for MyPlot { type Element = PlotElement<Self>; … }`;
`#[derive(IntoPlot)]` now generates exactly that. Base plot motion is
motionless by default, and `gpui-component` projects its motion tokens onto
`gpui_base::Theme::plot` whenever its theme is applied. The `decimal` feature
moves to `gpui-base`; `gpui-component`'s `decimal` feature forwards to it.

#### Added: chart appear motion

Charts draw their data in the first time they are painted, over 1000 ms on
`easeOutQuart`: line, area, candlestick and sankey charts reveal from the left,
bars grow out of the zero line together, a pie sweeps clockwise
and a radar grows out of its center. Axes, grids and labels are there from the
first frame, the tooltip waits until the data is whole, and reduced motion
skips it. New data paints in place, so a chart fed live quotes does not replay.

```rust
pub fn appear(self, appear: bool) -> Self       // every chart: opt out, e.g. in list rows
pub fn appear_key(self, key: impl Hash) -> Self // every chart: replay when the key changes
```

Custom plots opt in through `gpui_base::plot`:

```rust
pub struct PlotAppear // progress(), staggered(index, count, spread), is_appearing(), complete()
fn Plot::appear(&mut self, appear: PlotAppear, window: &mut Window, cx: &mut App)
fn Plot::appear_generation(&self) -> Option<u64> // Some opts in; a new value replays
fn Plot::interactive(&self) -> bool              // hover and tooltip, apart from the id
pub fn PlotMotion::with_appear(self, appear: Transition) -> Self
pub struct PlotAppearScope                       // remembers finished appears across remounts
impl PlotAppearScope {
    pub fn new(id: impl Into<ElementId>, child: impl IntoElement) -> Self
}
```

A chart that stops being painted forgets its appear, so one in a virtual list
draws in again whenever it scrolls back into view. Wrap the list in a
`PlotAppearScope` and each chart inside draws in once; the memory lasts while
the scope is painted, so closing the view or renaming the scope draws the
charts in afresh.

Every new `Plot` method has a default, so existing plots compile and behave as
before: `Plot::interactive` is `true`, and without an `appear_generation` a plot
tracks no appear and asks for no frames. A chart with `interactive(false)` now
returns its id from `Plot::id`, keeping its appear and path caches but still no
hitbox.

#### Breaking changes

##### Plot API

Charts built from `LineChart`, `BarChart`, `AreaChart`, `PieChart`,
`RadarChart`, `CandlestickChart` and `SankeyChart` are unaffected apart from
the new `f32` support. Custom plots built on the primitives need these changes:

- Scale ranges are two-element arrays and domains take any iterator:
  `ScaleLinear::new(values, [height, 0.])`; the same for `ScalePoint` and
  `ScaleBand`.
- The value bound is the documented `PlotValue` (`f32`, `f64`, and `Decimal`
  with `decimal`), replacing the hidden `Sealed`.
- `Scale::least_index` is `nearest_index`; `least_index_with_domain` is removed.
- `ScaleBand::band_width` no longer caps bands at 30px; set
  `ScaleBand::max_band_width`, or `BarChart`/`CandlestickChart::max_band_width`
  (30px by default, so charts look the same).
- `PlotAxis` places its labels at paint time, so builder order no longer
  matters. `AXIS_GAP` is `axis_gutter(font_size)`.
- `StrokeStyle` is `Curve` and `stroke_style` is `curve`; `dot_fill_color`/
  `dot_stroke_color` are `dot_fill`/`dot_stroke`.
- `Arc::paint`, `paint_cached` and `contains` drop the radius overrides; build
  another `Arc` for other radii.
- `PlotHover::focus` and `Tooltip::focus` are `progress`.
- `Grid::x`/`y` take any iterator of pixels; drop a `.collect()` whose type was
  only inferred from the old `Vec` parameter.
- `TooltipState`, `AxisText`, `label::Text`, `ArcData`, `StackPoint`,
  `StackSeries`, `SankeyLink` and the Sankey layout records are
  `#[non_exhaustive]`; build them with their constructors.
- `#[derive(IntoPlot)]` generates `type Element = PlotElement<Self>` instead of
  an `Element` impl on the plot; `gpui_base::Theme` gains a `plot` field.

`StrokeStyle` and `stroke_style` are removed outright. Deprecated aliases keep
`AXIS_GAP`, `dot_fill_color`, `dot_stroke_color` and `focus` compiling for this
release.

```diff
- let y = ScaleLinear::new(values.collect(), vec![height, 0.]);
+ let y = ScaleLinear::new(values, [height, 0.]);
- Line::new().stroke_style(StrokeStyle::Linear).dot()
+ Line::new().curve(Curve::Linear).dot()
```

##### Root layers

The following `gpui-component` APIs have been removed:

- `Root::render_dialog_layer`
- `Root::render_sheet_layer`
- `Root::render_notification_layer`

Remove these calls from application render methods. There are no replacement
layer switches or manual mounting APIs; Root renders all three layers itself.
Existing custom layer positions move to Root's window-level overlay placement.

```diff
 div()
     .size_full()
     .child(self.content.clone())
-    .children(Root::render_sheet_layer(window, cx))
-    .children(Root::render_dialog_layer(window, cx))
-    .children(Root::render_notification_layer(window, cx))
```

If a render method first stored these layers in local variables, remove those
variables and the corresponding `.children(...)` calls as well.

`window.open_dialog`, `window.open_sheet` and `window.push_notification` remain
the application-facing APIs. Keep a `Root` as the window's root view, or use the
new window helper below.

#### Added: `gpui_base::Root` and `gpui_kit::open_window`

```rust
pub fn open_window<V: Render>(
    options: WindowOptions,
    cx: &mut App,
    build: impl FnOnce(&mut Window, &mut App) -> Entity<V>,
) -> Result<(AnyWindowHandle, Entity<V>)>
```

Opens a window and returns both the window handle and the content entity. The
helper always wraps content in `gpui_base::Root`, independent of Cargo features.
The helper is defined only in Kit. `component::Root` re-exports the Base type.

Base owns the root, content, overlay hosting, keyboard traversal and selection
copying. Explicit `gpui_component::init` registers a per-window extension for
styled dialogs, sheets, notifications, tooltips, menus, touch selection and
window presentation. Base does not depend on Component or its theme. Plugins
must be registered before creating windows; they do not retrofit existing roots.

Component operations belong to `WindowExt`; the previous Component-specific
Root methods and fields (including `notification`) are no longer exposed on Root.

```rust
let (window, view) = gpui_kit::open_window(WindowOptions::default(), cx, |window, cx| {
    cx.new(|cx| MyApp::new(window, cx))
})?;
```

Call `gpui_kit::init(cx)` before opening component-backed windows, and do not
return a Root from this helper's builder. In an async context, call the helper
inside `cx.update`.

Kit examples and the native/web story galleries use this helper for standard window
startup. Base examples continue using `gpui_base::init` and GPUI's window API
directly, without a dependency on Kit. The FPS example disables Kit's default
features.

Quit and close-window actions, keyboard shortcuts and confirmation flows remain
application-owned. Kit initialization does not install default quit or close
bindings.

The `Root` and `WindowExt` text-selection methods are removed. Use
`gpui_base::TextSelection::{selected_text, has_selection, clear, end}`.
